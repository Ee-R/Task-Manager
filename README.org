**  Task Manager App
Custom app used for practicing CRUD operations on a MongoDB database using Atlas.
Tech used:
 - Plain Javascript on frontend with axios api.
 - NodeJS (with dotenv, nodemon, mongoose, and express itself).
 - Express Framework.
 - MongoDB.
The idea of the app, as said, was practice. This has no auth and anyone can tinker it so itsn't a good a idea to upload it with a working database and all the show.
